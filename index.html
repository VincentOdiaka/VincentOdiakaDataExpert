									<h2><a href="#">Maximizing Marketing Efficiency: Insights from Bristol Campaigns Using Microsoft Excel</a></h2>
									<p>This project analyzes data from Bristol Company on its marketing activities, focusing on customer demographics, campaign performance, and key KPIs. 
										The average conversion rate for the period is 87.65%, reflecting a strong marketing strategy. Customers with incomes between $50k-$100k represent the largest segment (39.21%) 
										and have a conversion rate of 89%. PPC campaigns lead in conversion rates, while email campaigns show high engagement through open and click rates.

										<h2><a href="#"> Customers and Products Analysis Using SQL – A Case Study on MiniTorque Motors<br />
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/MiniTorque Motors.png" alt="MiniTorque" /></a>
									<p>This project explored how data can drive smarter decisions at MiniTorque Motors, a scale model car business. 
										We began by identifying which products to restock using two key metrics: low stock ratio and product performance. This helped us spotlight high-demand, high-revenue items that deserve priority in inventory planning.
										Next, we turned our attention to customers. By calculating profit per customer, we segmented them into VIPs and low-engagement groups. This allowed us to tailor marketing strategies—rewarding top contributors and reactivating quiet customers. 
										Through SQL queries and data analysis, we transformed raw sales data into actionable business insights.
									</p>
									<p> Products like the 1960 BSA Gold Star DBD34 and 1968 Ford Mustang showed both high demand and strong sales, making them top candidates for restocking.</p>
									<p> VIPs like Diego Freyre (Madrid) and Susan Nelson (San Rafael) generated significant profits.
									    Low-engagement customers like Mary Young and Leslie Taylor showed minimal activity.
									</p>
									<p>This project demonstrates how SQL can turn raw sales data into strategic insights. 
										By analyzing product performance and customer profitability, MiniTorque Motors can:
										Prevent stockouts of best-selling items.
										Focus marketing efforts on high-value customers.
										Re-engage underperforming segments, and
										These data-driven strategies enhance both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

										<h2><a href="#">Machine Learning-Based Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn at Reder Telecom Using Python<br />
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Telecom.png" alt="Telecom" /></a>
									<p>This was a unique project that was conducted on Reder Telecom’s customer data using Python.
										The primary objective was to analyze customer churn and identify key factors influencing it.
										The analysis involved extensive data pre-processing, feature engineering, 
										and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn. The dataset contained several features of which 6 had more influence on the label.
										Two Machine Learning Algorithms were trained and evaluated, and the Logistic Regression Model performed better than Decision Trees with an accuracy score of 0.98.

										<h2><a href="#">Prediction of Hepatitis C Virus: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms Using Python
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Hepatitis C Virus.png" alt="Hepatitis C Virus" /></a>
									<p>Hepatitis C is a liver infection that poses challenges in early detection and lacks available vaccines. 
										To address this, non-invasive biomarkers and imaging techniques have been used for diagnosis. 
										This project evaluated five machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of Hepatitis C, identifying six key blood serum markers: "AST," "BIL," "GGT," "CHE," "ALB," and "ALT" as important predictors. 
										Among the algorithms, the Random Forest algorithm performed the best with 96% accuracy, 92% specificity, and 96% precision, making it the recommended model for Hepatitis C prediction.</p>

										<h2><a href="#"> Microsoft Power BI-Driven Approach to Balance Demand and Supply at Cazolo Pizza<br />
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Calozo Pizza.png" alt="Calozo Pizza" /></a>
									<p>Cazolo Pizza has been facing operational challenges, including frequent stockouts, overproduction of certain pizza types, and difficulties with staff availability. 
										To address these issues, Power BI was used to analyze detailed pizza order data, providing valuable insights into sales patterns, pizza preferences, and peak business hours. 
										The analysis revealed that Veggie pizza contributed the most to revenue, accounting for 26.91% of total sales. 
										However, the variation in revenue contributions among the four pizza categories was minimal, suggesting a balanced customer preference across different types. 
										In terms of size, large pizzas were the most popular, generating $375.32k in revenue, far outpacing other sizes. Cazolo’s busiest time of day was identified as between 1200 GMT and 1300 GMT, 
										indicating a need for optimal staff scheduling during this period. Furthermore, the pizzas in highest demand were the Classic Deluxe, Barbecue Chicken, The Hawaiian, Pepperoni, and Thai Chicken.
										Based on these insights, it is recommended that Cazolo Pizza optimize inventory management to prevent stockouts, improve demand forecasting to avoid overproduction, 
										and adjust staffing levels to better align with peak demand times.
